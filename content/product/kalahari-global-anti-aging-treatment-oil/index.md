It can visibly lift, tone and tighten skin with natural Arginine and Lysine. These peptides relax facial muscles just like having a Botox. Thanks to its rich Omega 6 fatty acids, the oil penetrates deeply to help rejuvenate and create healthy glowing skin by stimulating skin cell growth and restructuring skin cells to keep skin supple, firm, and youthfully radiant.
