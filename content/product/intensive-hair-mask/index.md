Enrich is an intensive anti-hairloss hair mask blending the most exotic, beneficial oils proven for hair revitalization. Enrich works to significantly improve dry/damaged and brittle hair. Precise amounts of fatty acid-rich plant oils from Japanese Tsubaki oil and organically-wildcrafted Pacaxi oil and potent active herbal infusions, including Waratah extract and sandalwood extract create a powerful synergy to build keratin and dramatically soften, restore shine, elasticity, and manageability.
