**The revolutioary Le Soleil Body protection** uses a specially developed proprietary enwrapping technique to stabilize the organic sunscreens and to ensure high performance with prolonged and consistent SPF values. The aqueous **encapsulated Sunscreen** is non-irritant, waterproof and not absorbed into the skin, and can also provide a longer skin surface residence time as well as reproducible SPF values with broad spectrum protection (PA++++). Formulated with organic extract and brightening Kakadu plum extract which is the richest natural source of vitamin C, this sunscreen serum helps brighten and repair damaged skin while leaving skin comfortable all day long.
